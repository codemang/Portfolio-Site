      -#     <p>As a frequenter of <h href="https://reddit.com/r/diy">r/diy</h>, I have seen several submissions of wooden low poly art. Low poly art is a class of artwork that renders real life images (usually of nature or animals) as a collection of distinct polygons and complementary colors. One day I found this low poly rendering of a fox, and convinced myself that I had to take a stab at creating a wooden version of it.</p>

      -#       <p class="project-p-with-image-left">I first loaded up this image into Inkscape, a photo editing software. I proceeded to outline all the polygons using the pencil tool. I also added numbers to each tile. This will prove to be very useful later on. </p>

      -#       <p class="project-p-with-image-left">Through my work I have access to a laser cutter for free! I picked up some one dollar scrap wood from Home Depot that worked perfectly for my needs. I cut out the edges of the outline, and etched the numbers into the wood. The numbers made it much easier to re-assemble my fox once I painted it.</p>

      -#       <p>This was the most time consuming part of the process. I first did two coats of primer, then one to two coats of paint. I used acrylic primer and paint for this.

      -#       <p>I bought a plank of common wood from Home Depot and used a circular saw to cut out three equally sized segments. After some sanding, I proceeded to stain it with a dark walnut, and then multiple coats of white-wash to give it a weathered barn look</p>

      -#       <p>When I cut out the fox, I kept the original sheet of wood. I used that piece of wood as a frame to hold the individual tiles together while gluing. I went tile by tile until they were all glued to the background.</p>
